# Overall Instructions

For this test we would like you to build a simple take-away ordering web app.

We have provided you a JSON file of dish names with prices and whether dishes are vegetarian or not. That file is located [here](/menu.json)
Please note that this particular restaurant names all its dishes after people.

Please refer to the User stores below to guide your work.

## Technologies

The app must be written in typescript using React. Otherwise you may use any additonal libraries you like.

We will look at how you choose to style your web app and you may use what ever styling libaries you like.

## Timing

We do not expect you to spend more than 2 - 4 hours on this test but if you wish to do more you are of course welcome to.
